<p># info-about-me I am 50 years old have done many jobs in my life. The most exciting job was when i was a security officer.I was doing that  on and off for about 15 years.I love making birthday cakes for my kids when they were younger, and not just round or square cakes,a few of the cakes i have made are, a steam train cake. a carosel cake (that took 8 hours to make),poodle cake, and more. The reason I have changed  from doing security is i was involved in a road rage incident, where the other guy rammed into my car, and when i montioned him back he ran over my foot and broke 2 toes. And now i have trouble standing for long periods of time. That was nearly 3 years ago. my foot has healed  but still gives me pain every now and then.</p>
